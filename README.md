This is a fork of TheCritic's [Critical Orientation](https://github.com/bshuler/critical-Orientation) mod, with a few changes made to suit my needs (plus on Java 16 & Minecraft 1.17).

Pressing backslash (`\`) will snap your camera angle to a multiple of 45 degrees. Change the keybind in settings if you so wish.
