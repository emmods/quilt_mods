**Repeat No More** makes it so that you can't tick a repeater no mo' once it reaches full delay, made by request of my friend [unixbrain](https://u.emc.gs/unixbrain).

Press shift to override it and tick it over anyway. It also has a config option accessible from [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mod-menu) if you want to disable the mod entirely.
