[Requires Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

This is a fork of TheCritic's [Critical Orientation](https://github.com/bshuler/critical-orientation) mod, with a few changes made to suit my needs, updated to modern Minecraft versions.

Pressing backslash (`\`) will snap your camera angle to a multiple of 45 degrees. Change the keybind in settings if you so wish. There's also another key (`j`) which can snap to a configurable angle.

The `/align` command also allows you to align to an arbitrary amount of degrees.
