**Compass Commands** adds a few commands to set the compass target. This mod can be either on the server or the client; it works either way.
- `/compass set x y z` - Sets the compass target to the coordinates. The `y` doesn't really matter, but it has to be there anyway. `~` can be used.
- `/compass north|south|east|west|northwest|northeast|southwest|southeast` - Sets the compass target to the specified cardinal direction.
- `/compass spawn` - Sets the compass target to the world spawn.
- `/compass current` - Functionally equivalent to `/compass set ~ ~ ~`.
